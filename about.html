		At Hilix Research, we are focused in the mathematical sciences, computational technology, statistics, and lingiustics. Our flagship program is the Hilix STEMatic Database, currently in its first iteration. In the abstract, and also in a very concrete sense, the database is a subset genealogy of topics in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics &mdash; integrated with various computational attributes. Its signature feature is an innovative alignment of syntax verification algorithms, computable documents, text editing, content management, and symbolic computation. 
		<br>
		<br>
		HSDB is accessible to anyone interested in pursuing the formal sciences through digital means. It is designed, however, with particular consideration for the autodidact. Given its expansive network of professionals and academics, and its voluminous bank of verification and ranking algorithms, Hilix is the first standardized digital alternative to a traditional university track in STEM. Read this <a class="one" href="">document</a> to obtain a deeper understanding of the Hilix database, and its greater impact on academic currency.
		<br>
		<br>
		Our research program is progressively comprehensive, and centered around four primary domains of interest, i.e., mathematics, computer science, linguistics, and statistics. We explore topics that are both theoretically motivated, and practical in nature. In modest terminology, our mission is to advance the formal sciences by means of traditional reserch, but also by establishing a path to standardized scientific credentials that is consistent with the technological endowments of the twenty&ndash;first century. We believe that the current century, more so than any preceeding it, is in grave need of mathematicians, scientists, technologists, and engineers, to help improve our undestanding of human, and planetary patterns. Hence, we seek to make advanced scientific research, and functional academic currency more acccessible and abundant. Read our official mission statement to learn more about how we aim to achieve these and additional goals.
