		Dear friends, family, and supporters of all walks – I am a mathematician and software developer based in Berkeley, California. I am building a desktop application that will allow the user to work through the following University curricula autonomously and entirely free of cost:  
		<br>
		<br>
		[Berkeley][CalTech][MIT][Princeton] &mdash; Mathematics, computer science, logic, Linguistics, physics.

		Each of these programs has evolved over many decades of arduous trial and error, and the respective departments (commendably) make their curriculum stacks available to the public via their web pages and other means.
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Motivation</b>
		<br>
		I believe it is only a matter of time before colleges and universities are tuition free in the Unites States. I also believe that the classical pedagogical model (i.e. the Carnegie Unit + grade point averaging) employed by most educational institutions in the U.S. today will continue to improve over time. The market opportunity that is developing in parallel relates to the fact that contemporary Americans require a direct path from their personal computing stations to world-class tertiary credentials that is unencumbered by arbitrary costs, academic bureaucracy, classism, ancient pedagogical models, compulsory competition, dubious course work, ... , the list goes on.
		<br>
		<br>
		Nebula 1.0  (for macOS) will provide the most direct path to employment in science-technology-engineering-mathematics — no applications, no tuition, no normative assessments (GPA), no paperwork whatsoever, save for your TeX documents and a physical diploma of completion. Solving this problem requires (at minimum) a sophisticated application of mathematics, logic, linguistics, and software engineering. It also demands that we abandon the century-old Carnegie model and replace it with a theory of assessment that is relevant to the current state of personal computing. (You can read my approach here)
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>My background</b>
		<br>
		I studied mathematics and informatics as an undergraduate at the University of Oregon (traditionally a very competitive program). Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in the Group in Logic and Methodology of Science in the graduate division at UC Berkeley. I also chief Hilix Research and Technologies, Incorporated, the group of dedicated individuals working hard to bring Nebula 1.0 to a Macintosh near you. I began developing the theoretical foundation for this product as an undergraduate in Oregon, and we have finally begun work on the prototype. The aim is to complete the prototype within eight months of reaching the campaign goal – at which point we will open the project up to the first round of investment.
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Last word</b>
		<br>
		Our view at Hilix is that an elegant and robust desktop solution to secondary/tertiary accreditation in the sciences will:
		<br>
		<br>
		1. lift millions of Americans/earthlings out of poverty directly into the middle class
		<br>
		2. balance the continuous drive of automation in the job market
		<br>
		3. enable upward socioeconomic mobility and growth internationally 
		<br>
		4. improve public and environmental health by introducing millions of new scientists, technologists, engineers, and mathematicians into the global economy.
		<br>
		<br>
		Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have questions regarding Nebula, Hilix RT, or if you just wanna talk math :-)
		<br>
		<br>
		Thank you all for your contributions!
		<br>
		<br>
		Yours,
		<br>
		<br>
		L . M .
